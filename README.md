Real-time prediction markets that resolve in minutes, not days - showcasing Linera's instant finality and real-time capabilities.

<img src="./docs/flash-markets-architecture.png" width="700" alt="Flash Markets Architecture">

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Rust 1.86.0
- Linera CLI

### One-Command Deployment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/flash-markets
cd flash-markets
docker compose up -d --build
```

Wait for initialization (~2-3 minutes), then open:
- **Frontend:** http://localhost:3000
- **GraphQL:** http://localhost:8080/graphql

## 📖 Overview

Flash Markets is a decentralized prediction market platform where users can create and bet on outcomes that resolve in **minutes, not days** - something only possible on Linera's real-time blockchain.

### Key Features

- ⚡ **Ultra-Fast Markets** - Markets resolve in 1-60 minutes
- 🎯 **Instant Finality** - Bets confirmed instantly, no waiting for blocks
- 🤖 **Automated Resolution** - Oracle-based price feeds auto-resolve markets
- 💰 **Fair Payouts** - Algorithmic payout distribution (95% to winners, 5% platform fee)
- 🔗 **Multi-Chain Architecture** - Leverages Linera's unique microchain design
- 📊 **Real-Time Updates** - Live market data via event streaming

### Example Markets

- "Will BTC price be higher in 5 minutes?" (auto-resolves)
- "Will ETH go above $3000 in the next hour?" (auto-resolves)
- "Will Player A win this game round?" (manual resolution)
- "Will the next Ethereum block have >200 transactions?" (verifiable)

## 🏗️ Architecture

Flash Markets uses Linera's multi-chain architecture with three cooperating applications:

```
Master Chain (Admin)
    ↓
Market Chains (Active markets)
    ├── Market App (creates markets, accepts bets)
    ├── Token App (manages betting tokens)
    └── Oracle App (price feeds, auto-resolution)
    ↓
User Chains (Personal balances & bets)
```

### Three-Application System

#### 1. **Token App** - Token Management
- User balance tracking
- Daily bonus system (24h cooldown)
- Transfer & mint operations
- Cross-app balance calls

#### 2. **Market App** - Core Prediction Logic
- Market creation & lifecycle
- Bet placement & validation
- Payout calculation & distribution
- Market cancellation & refunds

#### 3. **Oracle App** - Price Feeds & Resolution
- Submit price feeds
- Auto-resolve markets by price
- Manual resolution (admin)
- Future: AI integration for complex markets

## 🎮 How It Works

### Creating a Market

```rust
// Example: Create a 5-minute BTC price prediction market
mutation {
  createMarket(
    marketType: {
      pricePrediction: {
        symbol: "BTC",
        targetPrice: 50000
      }
    },
    durationMinutes: 5
  )
}
```

### Placing a Bet

```rust
mutation {
  placeBet(
    marketId: 1,
    prediction: Up,    // or Down
    amount: "1000000"  // 1 token = 1,000,000 atto
  )
}
```

### Market Resolution Flow

1. **Market Closes** - After duration expires
2. **Oracle Checks Price** - Gets latest price feed
3. **Outcome Determined** - Price vs. target price
4. **Winners Calculated** - Based on pool ratios
5. **Payouts Distributed** - Automatic via smart contract

### Payout Formula

```
winner_payout = (bet_amount / winning_pool) * total_pool * 0.95
platform_fee = total_pool * 0.05
```

Example:
- Total pool: 100 tokens
- UP bets: 30 tokens (3 users)
- DOWN bets: 70 tokens (7 users)
- Outcome: UP wins
- Each UP bettor gets: (their_bet / 30) * 100 * 0.95 = ~3.17x return

## 🧪 Testing Locally

### Start Linera Node

```bash
linera net up
```

### Create Applications

```bash
# Publish token app
linera project publish-and-create token \
  --path token

# Publish market app
linera project publish-and-create market \
  --path market

# Publish oracle app
linera project publish-and-create oracle \

```

### Start GraphQL Service

```bash
linera service --port 8080
```

### Test Queries

```graphql
# Get token balance
query {
  accounts {
    entry(key: "User:YOUR_ADDRESS") {
      value
    }
  }
}

# List all markets
query {
  markets {

query {
  markets {
    entry(key: "1") {
      value {
        id
        status
        totalPool
        upPool
        downPool
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## 🎯 GraphQL API

### Token Operations

```graphql
# Get balance
query {
  accounts { entry(key: "User:ADDR") { value } }
}

# Claim daily bonus
mutation {
  claimBonus(owner: "User:ADDR")
}

# Transfer tokens
mutation {
  transfer(from: "User:ADDR1", to: "User:ADDR2", amount: "1000000")
}
```

### Market Operations

```graphql
# Create market
mutation {
  createMarket(
    marketType: { binaryEvent: { question: "Will it rain?" } },
    durationMinutes: 10
  )
}

# Place bet
mutation {
  placeBet(marketId: 1, prediction: Up, amount: "1000000")
}

# Resolve market (admin/oracle)
mutation {
  resolveMarket(marketId: 1, outcome: Up)
}

# Claim winnings
mutation {
  claimWinnings(marketId: 1)
}
```

### Oracle Operations

```graphql
# Submit price
mutation {
  submitPrice(symbol: "BTC", price: 50000)
}

# Resolve by price
mutation {
  resolveMarketByPrice(
    marketId: 1,
    symbol: "BTC",
    targetPrice: 49000
  )
}
```

## 🔗 Cross-Application Communication

Flash Markets demonstrates Linera's cross-application messaging:

### Market → Token (Balance Check)

```rust
let balance_response: TokenResponse = self.runtime
    .call_application(
        true,
        &params.token_app,
        &TokenOperation::Balance { owner: bettor }
    )
    .await?;
```

### Oracle → Market (Auto-Resolve)

```rust
self.runtime
    .call_application(
        true,
        &params.market_app,
        &MarketOperation::ResolveMarket { market_id, outcome }
    )
    .await?;
```

## 📝 Technical Details

### State Management

All applications use Linera's View system:

```rust
#[derive(RootView)]
#[view(context = ViewStorageContext)]
pub struct TokenState {
    pub accounts: MapView<AccountOwner, Amount>,
    pub daily_bonuses: MapView<AccountOwner, DailyBonus>,
    pub total_supply: RegisterView<Amount>,
}
```

### Operation Pattern

All operations follow this pattern:

```rust
async fn execute_operation(&mut self, operation: Self::Operation) -> Self::Response {
    match operation {
        Operation::DoSomething { params } => {
            // 1. Validate
            // 2. Check permissions
            // 3. Update state
            // 4. Call other apps if needed
            // 5. Return response
        }
    }
}
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails

```bash
# Ensure correct Rust version
rustup override set 1.86.0

# Clean and rebuild
cargo clean
cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

### GraphQL Not Working

```bash
# Check if service is running
linera service --port 8080

# Test with curl
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/graphql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"query { accounts { keys } }"}'
```

### Docker Issues

```bash
# Rebuild containers
docker compose down
docker compose up -d --build

# Check logs
docker compose logs -f
```
